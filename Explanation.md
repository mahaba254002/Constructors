# CONSTRUCTORS

- A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects.
- It is called when an object of a class is instantiated.
- Constructors are invoked when a class is instantiated, and memory is allocated for the object.

## Types of CONSTRUCTORS:

### Default Constructor:

A default constructor is a constructor that does not accept any value. It is mainly used to **initialize the instance variables** with default values. The default constructor is invoked implicitly by the compiler if there is no constructor defined in the class.

### Parametrized Constructors:

The parametrized constructor is the one that can initialize the instance variables with the given values.

## Rules of Constructors:

- The constructor name must be the same as the class name.
- Constructors must not have a return type, not even void.
