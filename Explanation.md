                CONSTRUCTORS:
It is a special method used to initialised objects
A constructor is call when an object of a class is called.
It is invoked/called when a class is instantiated, and the memory is allocated for the object.

              Types of CONSTRUCTORS:
Default constructor
constructor which does not accept any value. The default constructor is mainly used to initialize the instance variable with the default values.
A default constructor is invoked implicitly by the compiler if there is no constructor defined in the class.

Parametrized Constructors
The parameterized constructor is the one which can initialize the instance variables with the given values.

Rules of constructors
The constructor name must be the same as the class name.
must not have a return type, not even void.
